## This app is only useful for HP Community Volunteers to help compose macro images and urls

Log in and access your macros page.  If using chrome then right click, "view page source", and save as "macros.html"

Run MacroViewer, open the file, and select the option to save as a local File.  All supplemental demo files found are loaded immediately.

A tar with latest binaries can be downloaded if you do not wish to build the app.  There is no install app so you must unblock the app using the  app's properties.

The tar has a sample macro html, five supplemental macro txt's and a sample signatures.  You may copy any of the sample macros into your own macros.  

Images that are not URLs must be uploaded to your HP photo album and urls are cleaned of tracking info.
