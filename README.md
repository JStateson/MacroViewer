# MacroViewer - View and edit user macros and signatures
 
## This app is only useful for HP Community Volunteers and a dual monitor 2K system is recommended.

Click for <a href="https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/371770iB4D290AA0F681417" target="_blank">Image of main page</a> and RTF help files can be viewed in sources

A tar with latest binaries can be downloaded if you do not wish to build the app.  There is no install app so you must unzip the tar and <a href="https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/371726i4F7A8A35B3DFE493" target="_blank">will have to unblock</a> the .exe app before it can run.

The tar has a sample macro html from the forum, 8 supplemental macro files and a sample signature file.  You may copy any of the sample macros into your own macros.  

Images that are not URLs must be uploaded to your HP photo album and urls are cleaned of tracking info.

You can create macros, signatures, and hyperlinks, assemble images, search extensively thorough the macro collection and easily paste replies to users from the collection.

Supplemental macros files: HP (editable copy of macros.html), HW, OS, NET, LJ, DJ, OJ, PC, AIO.  Maximum of 50 macros each except HP which can have only 30.

If you wish to use your own macros you must: (1) log in and access your macros page.  If using chrome then right click, "view page source", and save as "macros.html" to replace the default file.

(2) Run MacroViewer, open "macros.html", and select the option to save as a local file (HP).  All supplemental demo files are unchanged and are loaded immediately.

Feel free to use the ISSUE tool for suggestions or to report bugs. The project "HP Search" is another tool useful for HP forum volunteers.
