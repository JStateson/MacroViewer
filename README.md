# MacroViewer - View and edit user macros and signatures
 
## This app is only useful for HP Community Volunteers to help compose macro images and urls

Log in and access your macros page.  If using chrome then right click and "view page source"

Save the source code of the page and save it as "macros.html".  This was only tested in Chrome.

Run MacroViewer and open the file.  If using demo files open "macros.html" first.

A tar with latest binaries can be downloaded if you do not wish to build the app.

There is no install app so you must inform windows to keep the download and you may have to unblock MacroViewer

The tar also has a sample macro html, five supplemental macro txt's and sample signatures

You may copy any of the sample macros into your own macros.

Images that are not URLs must be uploaded to your HP photo album and urls are cleaned of tracking
