# MacroViewer - View and edit user macros and signatures
 
## This app is only useful for HP Community Volunteers to help compose macro images and urls

Log in and access your macros page using chrome

Expose the source code of the page and save it as "macros.html"

Run this app and open the file.  There are demo macro files in the tar.

Image of main page is here https://tinyurl.com/2p98ry3k

A tar with latest binaries can be downloaded if you do not wish to build the app

The tar also has a sample macro html, two supplemental macro txt's and sample signatures

You may copy any of the sample macros into your own macros.

Images that are not URLs must be uploaded to your HP photo album
