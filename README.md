A tar with latest binaries can be downloaded if you do not wish to build the app

The tar also has a sample macro html, two supplemental macro txt's and sample signatures

You may copy any of the sample macros into your own macros.

Images that are not URLs must be uploaded to your HP photo album and urls are cleaned of tracking
