    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

Download Macros	Bring up your macro settings page so you can download it.

The PC and PRN macros are stored in the same folder as the application.  Any local images are also stored there.  Note that local images must be uploaded to the HP album before any user can see them.  You must switch yuur macro page to "source" and then save the source.  Macros are extracted from the file you saved.
These supplemental macros are stored as HTML-Markup but are displayed and can be edited as plain text for convenience.  A total of 60 are available for use but they are not written to the HP macros website.  They are local files.  You can create additional macros, test them, and then use windows copy and paste to reply to a user.

    <value>		UTIL HELP
1 - This dialog box makes it easy to configure an instructional link.   You have a URL that points to a site with useful information.        You have some instructions, and you want the user to click on a phrase
2 -  Enter the URL in the URL box
3 - Enter the phrase in the phrase box "HREF" 
4 - click "GO" and the URL and phrase will be combined to form the correct HTML result

For example
The phrase: "Product ID"
The  url: https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/ish_2039298-1862169-16
=== The result is ===
&lt;a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/ish_2039298-1862169-16" target="_blank"&gt;Product ID&lt;/a&gt; 

This result can be copied to the clipboard.  You can then paste it back into the macro edit page. Once in the main edit box you can add more instructions and click the "Show as page" to see if it works in a web page. </value>

  <data name="rEDIT.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>	Help with main screen (editing)
The Macro List contains up to 50 macros.  There are three macro sources:  HP HTTP macros, local PC macros and local Printer macros.  A fourth source is the local copy of the HP HTTP macros.  If there are any HTML errors in the macros a red colored error menu item will appear. 

If you click a row then the macro is transferred to the EDIT BOX on the right side of the main display.  If you double click then the macro is displayed the way a user will see it if markup is enabled.

Note that only the PC and Printer macro collection can be saved.  If you wish to update the HP macros you need to copy the markup to the windows clipboard, log into your macro setting page and replace the macros with the one in the clipboard. This can be done using the local HP HTML macro file. 
You create a local copy of the HP HTML macros and then edit those macros until there are no errors.  If there is an error the macro number will be red.  If the macro number is blue then the original HP HTML macro needs to be replaced wiht the local copy.  If the  macro number is not colored then there is not error
To replace the HP HTML macro at the HP community, right click the BLUE colored macro number.  This copies the body of the macro to the clipboard.  You can then log into your account and paste the macro body thus replacing your HP community one.
The macros downloaded from the HP community do not have errors.  If an HP HTML macro is marked red it is likely an error in this program or an un-caught error in your HP settings.

	Supplemental Table group
The group shows the name of the macro being edited and gives an option to SAVE or DELETE it. To create a macro click the NEW adjacent to the EDIT BOX and change the name of the macro.  Be sure to save it.

	Markup Editing
Remove markup to make it easy to read and edit.  If editing in markup mode, then you can add a newline or two instead of pressing enter.  You can copy the EDIT BOX to the windows clipboard or paste from the clipboard back to the EDIT BOX.  You can also save a copy to notepad for backup or scratch work.
To see the effect of your edits, click the Show As Page button.

	Adding images or urls
You can add an image or url to the EDIT BOX.  The UTILS menu is another way to add URLS but you need to copy and paste. If the image you add is a local PNG or JPG file, it cannot be seen by users.  You will need to upload the local file to your HP album.  Tools to do this conveniently are in the Manage Images dialog box.

	Using your macro in the HP community
You have a macro that looks good.  You remove markup and click the Show Page and the macros looks fine.  There are two things you can do with it.  You can add it to your own macro collection or just use it in a reply to a user.
1 - Reply to user:  Just copy from the display page and paste into the user reply.  You can also copy the text from the EDIT BOX but you MUST NOT SELECT MARKUP.
2 - Add to your macro list:  You close the display page as that is not used.  Select the markup option.  Copy the text in the EDIT BOX and paste it into one of the macro positions.  Text pasted into the HP macro list is BBCode or "markup"

	Using the Error menu item
Click the red ERROR menu item to bring up a list of macros that have errors.  The line number and the character offset will be shown and clicking on the name of the defectrive macro brings up notepad where you can look a the body of the macro and locate the line and character that thas the problem.
You do not edit using notepad.  Editing of the defective macro is done in the main menu and once edited you can click on "Save and Reload".  There can be more than one error but only one at a time is shown in the error dialog box.

	Using the differences menu item
Click to show differences.  If therre are also errors then click to show either errors or differences.  This menu item is only visible when the local HP macros are loaded.

	Pasting and working with URLs
An attempt was made to remove tracking information from URLs.  The button "Clean Clipboard URLs" strips tracking from any URLs you have copied to the clipboard.   Any URLs pasted into URL fields are stripped before usage.</value>

  <data name="rEDITLINK.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>		EDIT LINK dialog box

This tool allows you to replace a phrase with an object such as a URL that can be clicked on.  You can select a word or phrase with the cursor or just position the cursor in a space.

When you click on "EDIT LINK" the item you selected can be changed to an object such as a URL  If nothing is selected then an item can be inserted.
A box can be placed about the resut as explained below.	

		SET TEXT dialog box

When this pops up, you will see the text you selected, if any.  There is a place to enter the URL and you can select a phrase to preceed othe url and a phrase to follow it. Click "Form Object" to create the object and click "Test Object" to see it in the browser.  Optionaly you can surround your selection with a box.
Click "Apply and exit" to replace the text back it the main EDIT BOX with the new object

URLs -1---------------
For Example:, you positioned the cursor at the end of a paragraph in the  EDIT BOX and you want to form:
"Click HERE to see if you have cloud support."

Prefix:"Click"
Suffix:"to see if you have cloud support"
Selected Text:: "HERE"
URL: "https://d34z73bbtpzgej.cloudfront.net/"

The result in markup will be
Click &lt;a href="https://d34z73bbtpzgej.cloudfront.net/" target="_blank"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt; to see if you have cloud support

URLs-2----------------
For example, you selected a url and you want to make it into a hyperlink.  All you need to do is just click "Form Object" and then click "Apply and exit".  Do not enter anything in the URL box as it will be filled in automatically.  When you return to the main form, if you view the page your URL will be "clickable".


		Boxing the object

URLs, IMGs and TEXT--
Any text you select can be put into a table.  Click "Put In Box" to put the text you selected into a box. You can also form the object and put the new object into a box.
Putting text into a box makes it easy for anyone to select the text in the box and to use. 

For example:, the results in markup will be

Copy the following command and enter it into the administrator command prompt
&lt;table border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="100%"&gt;&lt;p&gt;WMIC diskdrive get model, size, mediaType, status&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

The user can run the command "WMIC  diskdrive get model, size, mediaType, status" easily as it is distinguished from other information in the reply to their question.</value>
