    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>	Menu Items - File
Read HTML file	This extracts macros from your HP macro settings page that download previously.  Limit of 30 macros
Load PC, AIO macro	This loads a set of 50 macros from your drive. AIO includes laptop and PC is for desktops.
Load LJ, DJ macro	This loads another set of 50 macros. One for Deskjet, one for Laserjet
Save macros	Can be used to create a local copy of the HP macros named HP.  It can be edited but is limited to 30 macros.
Download Macros	Bring up your macro settings page so you can download it.

The macros are stored in the same folder as the application.  Any local images are also stored there.  Note that local images must be uploaded to the HP album before any user can see them.  You must switch yuur macro page to "source" and then save the source.  Macros are extracted from the file you saved.
These supplemental macros are stored as HTML-Markup but are displayed and can be edited as plain text for convenience.  A total of 60 are available for use but they are not written to the HP macros website.  They are local files.  You can create additional macros, test them, and then use windows copy and paste to reply to a user.  

	Menu Items - Utils - Create and test URLs
This dialog box allows you to form URLs that optionally have a phrase that can be clicked on.  Images urls can be added but only manually.  This is used for testing and nothing is returned to the main dialog box.  You must use copy and paste to get the url back into this application.

	Menu Items - Utils - Remove local images
If you used the windows snip and paste to create an image than a local file was created.  This dialog box allows you to examine all local files and delete the oens that are no longer used. Local images files cannot be seen on the HP site.  Once uploaded to your HP photo album and replaced by the album url they need to be deletled.

	Menu Item - Signature
This dialog box allows you to create, test, and save variouis signatures

	Menu Item - Search
This dialog box allows you to search for word, phrases, or parts of words
For example 'battery" returns 
------------------------------------------------------------------
File	Mac#	Found	Name
HP	19	2	Battery Report and calibration
PC	16	1	Find Part
PC	18	1	Power button plan
PC	23	1	CMOS battery replace
AIO	3	1	Cooler for hot laptop
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Double click any row to get the informaton availablle, then
copy the information into yoor users response page.

	Menu Item - Move
This allows you to move macros from one file to another.  When you first download your forum macros they will end up in the file "HP" which can be edited.  Macros can be moved to different files for a better association.
HP has a copy of the HTML that was downloaded from your HP forum settings. It is limited to 30 macros.  All other files can have 50 macros

	Menu Item - Settings
You can specoify which browser to use when accessing your forum settings page and photo album.   The MacroViewer app uses WebView2 to display all sites.  That tool uses Edge.  If you do not have Edge installed this app will not display sites properly or at all.
If you enter your HP forum ID then the Edge or Chrome browser can bring up your photo album.  This app cannot log in.  You must have logged in earlier.  There is no communication between the browser or any web page and this app. 
This dialog box also allows the creation (and deletion) of supplemental signatures.  The text and image are appended to the body of the macro and are not part of your normal signature.

	Menu Item - Errors and Differences
Click to show differences.  If therre are also errors then click to show either errors or differences.  This menu item is only visible when the local HP macros are loaded.
Differences indicate that you need to upload the HP macro to update the one at the Forum.  You must then download the Forum one to keep it synchronized with the HP.  This is just a tool you can use to update the HP forum macros.</value>

    <value>		UTIL HELP
1 - This dialog box makes it easy to configure an instructional link.   You have a URL that points to a site with useful information.        You have some instructions, and you want the user to click on a phrase
2 -  Enter the URL in the URL box
3 - Enter the phrase in the phrase box "HREF" 
4 - click "GO" and the URL and phrase will be combined to form the correct HTML result

For example
The phrase: "Product ID"
The  url: https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/ish_2039298-1862169-16
=== The result is ===
&lt;a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/ish_2039298-1862169-16" target="_blank"&gt;Product ID&lt;/a&gt; 

This result can be copied to the clipboard.  You can then paste it back into the macro edit page. Once in the main edit box you can add more instructions and click the "Show as page" to see if it works in a web page. </value>

    <value>	Signature Help

The signature file is stored in the same folder as the application.  It contains HTML which can be edited.
Feel free to edit my signature to create your own. If you come up with some unique or unusual signature, please contribute them using the github issues tool.</value>

  <data name="rEDIT.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>	Help with main screen (editing)
The Macro List contains up to 50 macros.  There are three macro sources:  HP HTTP macros, local PC macros and local Printer macros.  A fourth source is the local copy of the HP HTTP macros.  If there are any HTML errors in the macros a red colored error menu item will appear. 

If you click a row then the macro is transferred to the EDIT BOX on the right side of the main display.  If you double click then the macro is displayed the way a user will see it if markup is enabled.

Note that only the local macro collection can be saved.  If you wish to update the HP macros you need to copy the markup to the windows clipboard, log into your macro setting page and replace the macros with the one in the clipboard. This can be done using the local HP HTML macro file. 
You create a local copy of the HP HTML macros and then edit those macros until there are no errors.  If there is an error the macro number will be red.  If the macro number is blue then the original HP HTML macro needs to be replaced wiht the local copy.  If the  macro number is not colored then there is not error
To replace the HP HTML macro at the HP community, right click the BLUE colored macro number.  This copies the body of the macro to the clipboard.  You can then log into your account and paste the macro body thus replacing your HP community one.
The macros downloaded from the HP community do not have errors.  If an HP HTML macro is marked red it is likely an error in this program or an un-caught error in your HP settings.

	Supplemental Table group
This group shows the name of the macro being edited and gives an option to SAVE or DELETE it. To create a macro click the NEW adjacent to the EDIT BOX and change the name of the macro.  Be sure to save it.

	Markup Editing
Remove markup to make it easy to read and edit.  If editing in markup mode, then you can add a newline or two instead of pressing enter.  You can copy the EDIT BOX to the windows clipboard or paste from the clipboard back to the EDIT BOX.  You can also save a copy to notepad for backup or scratch work.
To see the effect of your edits, click the Show As Page button.

	Adding images or urls
You can add an image or url to the EDIT BOX.  The UTILS menu is another way to add URLS but you need to manually copy and paste usign UTILS.  If the image you add is a local PNG or JPG file, it cannot be seen by users.  You will need to upload the local file to your HP album.  Tools to do this conveniently are in the Manage Images dialog box.

	Using your macro in the HP community
You have a macro that looks good.  You remove markup and click the Show Page and the macros looks fine.  There are two things you can do with it.  You can add it to your own macro collection or just use it in a reply to a user.
1 - Reply to user:  Just copy from the display page and paste into the user reply.  You can also copy the text from the EDIT BOX but you MUST NOT SELECT MARKUP.
2 - Add to your macro list:  You close the display page as that is not used.  Select the markup option.  Copy the text in the EDIT BOX and paste it into one of the macro positions.  Text pasted into the HP macro list is BBCode or "markup"

	Using the Error menu item
Click the red ERROR menu item to bring up a list of macros that have errors.  The line number and the character offset will be shown and clicking on the name of the defectrive macro brings up notepad where you can look a the body of the macro and locate the line and character that thas the problem.
You do not edit using notepad.  Editing of the defective macro is done in the main menu and once edited you can click on "Save and Reload".  There can be more than one error but only one at a time is shown in the error dialog box.

	Pasting and working with URLs
An attempt was made to remove tracking information from URLs.  The button "Clean Clipboard URLs" strips tracking from any URLs you have copied to the clipboard.   Any URLs pasted into URL fields are stripped before usage.
It seems that BING cannot be de-referenced or untracked.  If you use BING to search you should select one of the objects search for and NOT use the BING search phrase itself.

	Edit Link
This dialog box allows URLs and image URLs to be added to the main menu EDIT BOX.  Optionally you can put a box around the creeated object.
You can also create boxes with more than one row or column but you need to add the information into the box later.

	 Manage Images
The dialog box APPEND allows a screen capture to be dropped into a macro.  You must have already captured the image using the windows snip tool.  Alternately, you can enter the url to an image.  After the image is transfered to the main dialog box you can edit the markup to set the size.  Note that local images cannot be seen by a user so you must put the image in your forum photo album.
The MANAGE dialog box allows the local image to be uploaded to the HP album server and the local file path to be replaced by the image URL that is publically availabe.  Either your album or a site that has the image public.

	Clean Clipboard URLs.
If you ued Edge, Chrome, Firefox, etc. to copy a URL then the URL contains tracking information.  Clicking this button strips the tracking information from it.  This is on ongoing problem as sone website add tracking and referals and this tool might miss some items.  Please enter an issue and make a note of the site so that the program can be changed to remove the tracking.

	Paste from clipboard
This strips newlines from your clipboard before pasting into the EDIT BOX.  This assume you selected Swith To Markup.  The newlines are replaced by markup.  If you created a response to a users question and want to ave the response, then use the mouse to copy the response and then paste it into the EDIT BOX but be sure toenable markup and use the "Paste from clipboard".  You may need to run LINK All after pasting.

	SEARCH button
This allows you to search for a word or phrase quickly.  All files are searched.   If you recently added some macros they will not show up it the search unless the program is restarted.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="rEDITLINK.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>		EDIT LINK dialog box

This tool allows you to replace a phrase with an object such as a URL that can be clicked on.  You can select a word or phrase with the cursor or just position the cursor in a space.

When you click on "EDIT LINK" the item you selected can be changed to an object such as a URL  If nothing is selected then an item can be inserted.
A box can be placed about the resut as explained below.	

		SET TEXT dialog box

When this pops up, you will see the text you selected, if any.  There is a place to enter the URL and you can select a phrase to preceed othe url and a phrase to follow it. Click "Form Object" to create the object and click "Test Object" to see it in the browser.  Optionaly you can surround your selection with a box.
Click "Apply and exit" to replace the text back it the main EDIT BOX with the new object

URLs -1---------------
For Example:, you positioned the cursor at the end of a paragraph in the  EDIT BOX and you want to form:
"Click HERE to see if you have cloud support."

Prefix:"Click"
Suffix:"to see if you have cloud support"
Selected Text:: "HERE"
URL: "https://d34z73bbtpzgej.cloudfront.net/"

The result in markup will be
Click &lt;a href="https://d34z73bbtpzgej.cloudfront.net/" target="_blank"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt; to see if you have cloud support

URLs-2----------------
For example, you selected a url and you want to make it into a hyperlink.  All you need to do is just click "Form Object" and then click "Apply and exit".  Do not enter anything in the URL box as it will be filled in automatically.  When you return to the main form, if you view the page your URL will be "clickable".


		Boxing the object

URLs, IMGs and TEXT--
Any text you select can be put into a table.  Click "Put In Box" to put the text you selected into a box. You can also form the object and put the new object into a box.
Putting text into a box makes it easy for anyone to select the text in the box and to use. 

For example:, the results in markup will be

Copy the following command and enter it into the administrator command prompt
&lt;table border="1" width="100%"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="100%"&gt;&lt;p&gt;WMIC diskdrive get model, size, mediaType, status&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
